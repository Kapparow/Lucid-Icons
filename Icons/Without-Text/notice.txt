A lot of people have been requesting Lucid Icons without
the text at the bottom.. But you can imagine how 
ridiculously tasking it would be to manually crop out
the text and clean up each individual icon.

As a solution, I used a batch action edit, as accurately
as I could. So because of this, there will be some 
anomalies in the shadows and glows. I apologize for that, 
but I hope you'll appreciate the addition of text-less 
versions of Lucid icons anyways.
